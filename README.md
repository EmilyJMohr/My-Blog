## A Front End Project

*Last update before the clock strikes!* 
**Still** need to finish the form; use the grid; and flush out the css. Will continue to update. Also plan to incorporate the previous i
nventory project as another link and put the wireframe on the ReadMe.md. Unfortunately I need to redo the wireframe due to a missing file when I changed laptops. Using the ReadMe.md to know where to pick back up. Hoping to use the eventual flushed out site as both a portfolio piece and as a working site to sell personally created objets d'art.
